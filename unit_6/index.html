		<h3>It's a boy, It's a girl&mdash;No it's a tiny germ incubator with a brain</h3>		
		<p>Why focusing beyond gender is essential to making sure you kid's got smarts.<br>
		Bobby plays with blocks and Betty plays with Barbie. We all are highly aware of gender stereotypes and have vowed not to peg our own little one into a strictly boy or girl shaped whole. However, society, Target, your mother-in-law, and our own lazy selves make it easy to drift towards what is labeled pink or what is labeled blue. However, if Betty is a classic G.I.R.L. and L.O.V.E.S. dolls, does that mean she will fall behind Bobby who is busy stacking blocks, a seemingly mundane activity that actually is crucial in helping him develop essential skills?

		<h3>Check your pulse&mdash;Have you had a moment to breathe today?</h3>
		<p>Just because there is no "I" in motherhood doesn't mean you shouldn't dedicate time to focusing on yours truly.<br>
		Sure, between your partner's happy hour and/or shuffleboard habit, your kiddo's swim, soccer, and interpretive dance classes, and your dog’s vigorous walk schedule, it can be hard to pencil in a few moments of rest and relaxation for good ol’ mom. But can you even attempt to be the best parent you are capable of being without checking in on your own psyche? Here we make the case for clearing the schedule for a serious detox of distractions and responsibilities. A few minutes of working on yourself can do wonders for your family.</p>
